# Financial-Stock-Market-Analysis
During this project, I worked on data analysis in the FinTech domain with a focus on financial stock market analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The work involved studying and analyzing various financial documents, including reports, news articles, and market data, to extract meaningful insights. I explored different NLP methodologies for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and topic modeling to evaluate market trends and investor sentiment. Additionally, implemented techniques for processing and structuring unstructured financial data, contributing to a deeper understanding of stock market behavior through computational analysis.
